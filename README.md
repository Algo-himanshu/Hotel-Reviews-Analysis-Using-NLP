## Overview



## Business Problem
One of the biggest problems that many companies have been battleling is how to take advantage of all the data that is collected by them. This problem will increase faster with the advance of technology and how connected people are. The travel industry has been challenged by the amount of data. One of the types of data is reviews left by guests in websites such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.

The hotel's subsector has been trying to find ways to analyze the reviews and find ways to improve their business based on their guests experiences. Some hotels can receive thousands of guests every week and hundreds of reviews. It becomes nearly impossible for hotels to keep track of the reviews and find out areas where they need to improve and understand what they are doing right, so they can make sure that they can keep it up.
