##### This project is expected to be concluded on January 6, 2021.

## Overview



## Business Problem
One of the biggest problems that many companies have been battleling is how to take advantage of all the data that is collected by them. The travel industry has been challenged by the amount of data. One of the types of data is reviews left by guests in websites such as Booking.com, TripAdvisor, and Yelp.

Hotels have been trying to find ways to analyze the reviews and get insights out of it. However, some hotels can receive thousands of guests every week and hundreds of reviews. It becomes nearly impossible and expensive for hotels to keep track of the reviews. Thus, multiple hotels might negligete these valuable data due to the cost and energy that need to be allocated.

For these reasons, here are a few questions that I will try to answer with this project:

1. Can machine learning be used to correctly identify positive or negative reviews?
2. Can NLP be used to create a useful word cloud with the the positive and negative reviews?
3. How is a specific hotel compared to the other hotels in the same city? Can we find more information about the guests based on their review?

## Data and Methods
The dataset for this project was originally used in a study called Text Mining in Hotel Reviews: Impact of Words Restriction in Text Classification by Diego Campos, Rodrigo Rocha Silva, and Jorge Bernadino and a team at University of Coimbra. You can find the paper [here](http://https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336224346_Text_Mining_in_Hotel_Reviews_Impact_of_Words_Restriction_in_Text_Classification "here"). The raw dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jiashenliu/515k-hotel-reviews-data-in-europe/data "Kaggle").
